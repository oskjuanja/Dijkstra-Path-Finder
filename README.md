<h2>Dijkstra Pathfinding Algorithm</h2>  
The Dijkstra algorithm is an algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. This package provides tools to easily create and edit graphs and find the shortest path between a start and a target node in a grid of boxes, represented by said graph.
